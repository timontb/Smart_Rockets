# Smart-Rockets

A Python implementation of the [Smart Rocket Coding Challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/029-smartrockets.html) by The Coding Train.

This was made using Python 3.8

The rockets evolve according to a genetic algorithm and tries to find a path to the target and avoid the obstacle. However, this does not find the "best" path to the target.
